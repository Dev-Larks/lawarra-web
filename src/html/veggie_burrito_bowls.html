    <div class=recipe-body>
        <ul>150g (~ ¾ cup) brown rice</ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon oil</ul>
        <ul>3 spring onions, sliced</ul>
        <ul>1 bell pepper, diced (I used yellow)</ul>
        <ul>3 cloves garlic, minced</ul>
        <ul>12 cherry tomatoes, halved</ul>
        <ul>400g tin black beans, drained</ul>
        <ul>2 teaspoons smoked paprika</ul>
        <ul>100 ml (~ ⅓ cup) vegetable stock</ul>
        <ul>1 tablespoon hot sauce</ul>

            <li>Cook the brown rice according to the instructions on the packet - I boil mine in plenty of water until it's just soft (around 20 minutes), then drain.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat a dash of oil in a large, deep frying pan, and add the spring onions, diced pepper and garlic. Cook over a medium heat for 5 minutes, until softened.</li>
            <li>Add the halved cherry tomatoes, black beans, paprika, and a good pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook for a few minutes more, until the tomatoes are just softened. You can squish them a little to release their juice if you like.</li>
            <li>When the rice is cooked, add it to the vegetables, along with a little vegetable stock and a dash of hot sauce. Mix well to combine.</li>
            <br><p>Your choice of toppings, to serve, e.g. grated cheese, sour cream, guacamole, fresh coriander (cilantro), etc.</p>
