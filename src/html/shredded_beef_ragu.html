        <ol>
            <li>Pat beef dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
	    <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil over high heat, add beef and sear agressively on both sides until browned (3-5 minutes).</li>
	    <li>Turn heat down to medium-low, add remaining olive oil.</li>
	    <li>Add onion and garlic and sauté for 2 mins.</li>
            <li>Add the carrots and celery and sauté slowly for 5 mins.</li>
	    <li>Turn heat up on high, add wine, stir and simmer for 3 mins.</li>
            <li>Then transfer all ingredients to the slow cooker.</li>
            <li>Add all remaining ingredients, but DO NOT add water.</li>
            <li>Slow cook on low for 6-8 hours, then shred beef.</li>
	    <li>Cook pasta, while pasta cooks take 5 cups of the ragu and put it into a pan</li>
	    <li>When the pasta is ready, transfer it directly from the pot into the fry pan using tongs.</li>
	    <li>Add 3/4 cup of pasta water into the fry pan.</li>
	    <li>Gently toss the pasta (I use 2 wooden spoons) for 1 to 2 minutes, until the sauce water evaporates and leaves you with a thick Ragu sauce that coats the pasta.</li>
        </ol>
